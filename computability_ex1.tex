\textbf{Exercise 1:}
For convencience, we define the macros RI, LI as in the lecture:
\begin{compactitem}
\item RI $= (i,  \{
i:\;\gR{i+1},\;
i+1:\;\ITE{i+2}{i}
\})$
\item LI $= (i,  \{
i:\;\gL{i+1},\;
i+1:\;\ITE{i+2}{i}
\})$
\end{compactitem}
We define the program as $P=(1,A)$, where $A = \{$ 
\begin{compactenum}[1:]
\item \gR{2}
\item \ITE{0}{3}
\item \dB{4}
\item RI
\item RI
\item \dI{7}
\item \gR{8}
\item \dI{9}
\item LI
\item LI
\item \gR{2}
\end{compactenum}
$\}$.

\textbf{Exercise 3:}
$Func(P): f(x,y) = x*y$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\bigskip
\noindent
\textbf{Exercise 4:}
Let $F \in \{\PR, \R\}$. 
We assume that $f \in F$.
Note that the semantics of the $\Sigma$ operator adhere to the following equation:
\begin{align*}
\Sigma(f)(x,0) &= f(x,0) \\
\Sigma(f)(x, y+1) &= f(x,y+1) + \Sigma(f)(x,y)
\end{align*}
which we can rewrite as
\begin{align*}
\Sigma(f)(x,0) &= C(f; I^1, C^1_0)(x) \\
\Sigma(f)(x, y+1) &= C(plus; C(f; I^3_1, S \circ I^3_2), I^3_3) (x,y, \Sigma(f)(x,y))
\end{align*}
Let $g = C(f; I^1, C^1_0)$ and $h = C(plus; C(f; I^3_1, S \circ I^3_2), I^3_3)$. 
Since $g$ and $h$ only make use of the functions $f$ (which we assume to be a total function) and $plus$ (Example 3.0.4 showed that $plus \in cl_{Pr}(BF\cup S)$) as well as operators in $BF \cup S$, they are total functions.
Thus, we can equivalently write $\Sigma(f) = Pr(g, h)$, i.e, $\Sigma(f) \in cl_{Pr}(BF \cup S)$. 
We conclude that $\Sigma(f) \in \PR$ (immediate by the definition) and $\Sigma(f) \in \R$ (since $\Sigma(f) \in cl_{\{Pr \cup \mu \}}(BF \cup S)$ and total). 

\medskip
\noindent
The proof for the operator $\Pi$ is analogous (just substitute $plus$ by $times$).
\qed

\textbf{Exercise 5:}
Let $F \in \{\PR, \R\}$. 
We define $P^a(x,k)$ and $P^e(x,k)$ via the $Pr$ operator:
\begin{align*}
P^a(x, 0) &= P(x,0) \\
P^a(x, y+1) &= P(x,y+1) \land P^a(x,y) \\
\implies P^a &= Pr(C(P; I^1, C^1_1),  C(\land; C(P; I^3_1, S \circ I^3_2), I^3_3) 
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
P^e(x, 0) &= P(x,0) \\
P^e(x, y+1) &= P(x,y+1) \lor P^e(x,y) \\
\implies P^e &= Pr(C(P; I^1, C^1_1),  C(\lor; C(P; I^3_1, S \circ I^3_2), I^3_3) 
\end{align*}
Since $P(x,y) \in Pred^{k+1}(F)$ and $F$ is closed under $\land$ resp.~$\lor$ (shown in Theorem 3.0.1) and all other functions and operators are basic ones, we conclude that $P^a(x,k),\; P^e(x,k) \in F$.
